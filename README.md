# Introducing the Flatiron Programming Process

## Learning Goals

- Use the Flatiron Programming Process

## Introduction

Now that we've started thinking a like a programmer, let's get deeper with some
tried and true specific Flatiron strategies for solving a code problem.

### Use the Flatiron Programming Process

#### Identify the problem

- What must this code accomplish? Don’t merely focus on the output (e.g. 2), but
- rather focus on the need of the customer or fellow programmer.

#### Identify the output that would solve the problem

- “A beautiful Persian rug that really ties the room together” A PBJ sandwich,
- “divided along the diagonal to make two triangles of hunger-relief” An
- “average, a whole number with two-places of numbers after the decimal”

#### Name the procedure that fixes the problem

- “Weave Persian Rug” Make Diagonal Cut PBJ Sandwich” Average Numbers”

#### Identify what inputs are needed to create the output

- Collection of threads, a loom, and a pattern Ingredients, knife, cutting
- board, plate List of numbers; the count of the numbers

#### Define the procedure’s implementation: the steps that combine inputs to
#### produce outputs

- Use the documentation to help find ways to keep your implementation simple and
- readable Use `.class` to find out the class of your inputs and look up their
- documentation to see if heavy lifting work has been done for you If you see
- that it has, but you don’t understand how to use it, experiment in IRB and
- bring your new understanding to your implementation’s design

#### Verify procedure’s output

- Loop:
  - Adjust input
  - Adjust implementation
  - Spin-off sub-procedures
  - Verify output (if necessary)
  - Move from success to success, accumulating success

#### Translate the procedure description into code as defined by the syntax of
#### the language

## Conclusion

Remember—coding is your last step! The more we can break down and think through
a problem, using this Flatiron process, the easier and better our code will be.
